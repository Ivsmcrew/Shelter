## Shelter

"Shelter" is a site with animals. Implemented such things as adaptivity, pop-up cards, infinity slider, pagination and some other features with JS

This project was the first one in which I used Javascript. It gave me experience at the following points: 

- Semantic HTML, prepros SCSS
- Structuring of a project, separating a code into different files( preconditions for BEM )
- Using of npm( npm-run, node_modules, package.json)
- ES6+ features( arrow funcs, modules, classes, etc )
- working with DOM API

It was really interesting projects with new kinds of difficults. Failed to fully adhere to the BEM system, which is why there is a little mess in styles and scripts.
